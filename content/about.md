<p class="message"> I'm currently an Analytics Engineer at NJOY, where I'm responsible for building reliable data models, developing tools that drives data democratization throughout the organization, maintaining data pipelines, and building dashboards and visualizations for stakeholders. </p>

Previously, I was designing and analyzing A/B and multivariate tests at [Jet.com](Jet.com), providing recommendations to Product Management, Marketing, and User Experience (UX) Design, based on test findings.

## Setup

Some fun facts about the setup of this project include:

* Built for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)
* Developed on GitHub and hosted for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)
* Coded with [Sublime Text 2](http://sublimetext.com), an amazing code editor
* Designed and developed while listening to music like [Blood Bros Trilogy](https://soundcloud.com/maddecent/sets/blood-bros-series)
